Why Synthesis?

Synthesis is known for delivering exceptional data models and products which unravel the stories of the people they represent and inspire our partners with the confidence to act.

Partnering with the world’s most successful brands in fashion, beauty, content and travel, we’re building specialised solutions to solve problems of planning for the future. Rooted in culture, tested in data science, we spot and anticipate changes and connections in culture to inspire action and help brands grow with a new wave of audiences. After three years of iteratively developing and perfecting these models, we are preparing to launch a series of products over the next 5 years.

We will be at the forefront of a shift towards leveraging open data to develop rich, honest, human insight. In an industry that has for too long relied on ‘question-response’ approach to understanding changes in behaviour, we prioritise layering behavioural, performative, search and sales data to highlight the discrepancies between what people say they do and what they actually do. We see a $20 billion industry that has failed to innovate for too long and we are just getting started.

The Role

As a Data Scientist at Synthesis you’ll develop models and analytical frameworks designed for the sharpest insights and marketing professionals in the world, helping them prioritise the issues that matter most to their business and spot where the next big change will come from. We aggregate information from open data sources, advocating for the power of data to solve problems for business and for society as a whole, which means you will be running end-to-end analysis guiding the process from data gathering and cleaning through to processing, modelling and visualisation.

You’ll become an expert in layering datasets to build a complete picture of people’s behaviour, working with search, social, advertising & ecommerce datastreams to name just a few. Ours is a spirit of continuous experimentation and plussing: you’ll always be pushing your ideas in collaboration with a team of experienced data scientists around you. We work in tight-knit project teams, meaning you’ll work side by side with cultural strategists to interpret meaning in the data patterns we see and present your work to our client partners, so you see first-hand the impact your work has.

Requirements
You have a solid understanding of statistical analysis and hands-on experience with one or more of the following programming languages: Java, Python or R.
You have experience in building data visualizations using off the shelf software or packages with R, Python, Gephi, Tableau etc. Familiarity with quick prototyping techniques for data viz work is an advantage.
You are comfortable working with large, complex, unstructured datasets, with a focus on text and image-processing. Natural language processing skills, including topic modelling and semantic parsing, especially for Asian languages and short texts, will be an advantage.
You’re able to communicate your analysis in simple, non-technical terms and relish the prospect of working alongside a team of strategy consultants to move from analysis to implication for business.
You enjoy iteratively developing your ideas, drawing on the value of the diverse experience and perspectives of those around you. You recognise the value of having an array of approaches at your disposal rather than focusing solely on one methodology or model.

846,30,Singapore,Data scientist,Research Scientist in Artificial Intelligence Education Centre (OER) [NIE],Nanyang Technological University,,3.8,151,Singapore,"Overview
The Office of Education Research (OER) of the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore, encompass 5 programme research areas in:
Cognitive, Emotional and Social Learning (CESD)
Lifelong Learning, Cognition and Wellbeing (LLCW)
Learning Sciences & Innovation (LS&I)
Schools, Leadership and System Studies (SLSS)
Teacher Professionalism and Learning (TPAL)
Since 1 April 2008, the Office of Education Research (OER) has led efforts to spearhead programmes grounded in the principles of advancing research, development and innovation at NIE. The Office is committed to providing the resources and support systems – through the governance, monitoring, quality assurance and dissemination of education research – that will produce high-quality education research with impact on policy and practice.
NIE’s research is guided by the Research and Development Framework – a policy-driven, evidence-based framework that guides academic and research staff to improve the quality of teaching and learning in Singapore schools and to build on NIE's standing as a leading international research institution.
The Office aims to conduct rigorous, relevant multidisciplinary research and development that inform policy, pedagogy and practice in Singapore and internationally. With a strong focus on advancing knowledge in the 5 priority areas above, the Office provides researchers with valuable research opportunities and platforms to enhance their global academic profile.
The Office is looking for Research Scientists to join their research efforts in the strategic university area in Artificial Intelligence Education (AIED).
Today, we are all operating in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) supported world. To be effective and successful in this kind of world, we need to develop the competencies, skills and dispositions to learn, relearn and unlearn in response to the changes in the workplace. To remain competitive in a VUCA world, the Singapore Government has initiated the skillsfuture movement to ensure that the “skills, passion and contributions of every individual will drive Singapore's next phase of development towards an advanced economy and inclusive society”. Skillsfuture for educators requires teachers to be literate with AI and its advancements and to consider how such emerging technologies can be embraced in the teaching and learning praxis.
NIE/NTU is a premier institution with strong roots in education and has more recently developed a wealth of research-practice nexus understandings on learning and learners’ cognition and emotion with the NTU schools such in medicine and the humanities. Hence, AI and Science of Learning (SoL) should co-inform each other. With NIE’s wealth of knowledge in evidence-based practices that are contextualised, effective and scalable for adoption in K-12 schools, it can potentially scale up AI and SoL research in education interventions. The role of research is thus to provide the evidence that guides the practice and, more importantly, to allow the practice to extend into new contexts.

SMART CAMP addresses key technology bottlenecks in cell therapy manufacturing: (i) critical quality attributes of safe, effective cell therapy products; and (ii) integrated process analytics to monitor and modulate those attributes. While cell therapies are poised to transform healthcare for both the industry and the patient, there remain many outstanding scientific and technical challenges to significant global impact that this R&D programme addresses. This high-impact focus includes measurement and feedback control of processing parameters (process analytic technologies, or PAT) that contribute to cell viability and function during cell proliferation, and the measurement at intermediate and final steps of the cell product properties correlated with positive therapeutic outcomes (critical quality attributes, or CQA).
This interdisciplinary team comprises engineers, biologists, clinicians, manufacturing, and data analytics experts from multiple MIT academic units, and multiple Singapore-based universities, research centres of excellence, and hospitals who are experienced at translational demonstrations of technologies in safety-regulated industries such as cell therapies. As with all postdoctoral associates (PDAs) in SMART CAMP based in Singapore, the PDA will work in a diverse team of experts including several principal investigators (PIs) and PDAs, and receive direct mentorship regarding career development from a pair of who are based in Singapore and at MIT, respectively.
CAMP’s unique, enabling and cross-cutting capabilities include cell and clinical biology, microfluidics, real-time optics and spectroscopies, 3D-printed devices, process analytics, data analytics, and bioinformatics. This programme will demonstrate these approaches required of cell-based personalized medicine through three translational testbeds (three Flagship Projects), ultimately facilitating access for more patients to life-saving, approved cell therapies for currently intractable health challenges. These flagship projects will address allogeneic and autologous cell therapy products, including but not limited to cell sources including adult stem/progenitor cells and immune cells for treatment of specific cancers, tissue degeneration, and autoimmune diseases.
Flagship Project 1: Label-free critical quality attributes (CQA) for personalized efficacy of cell therapies, including multivariate analysis of biological and biophysical attributes
Flagship Project 2: Rapid critical quality attributes (CQA) for safety of cell sources & cell therapy products, including process analytic technologies (PAT)
Flagship Project 3: Integrated process analytic technologies (PAT) for cell proliferation and recovery, including in-line and intermittent monitoring to promote efficacy and safety CQA
Responsibilities
CAMP Flagship Projects 1 & 3 are looking to fill 2 PDA positions for Immune/ hematopoietic cell process development.

We are recruiting PDAs for translational cancer therapy projects, with a focus on utilizing biological and engineering principles to improve current development processes (PATs) towards more efficacious therapeutic products with defined properties beneficial for end applications (CQAs). These PDAs will contribute to knowledge and skillsets for manipulation of immune/hematopoietic cell systems, to:
Establish the best practices for engineered cell manufacturing and culturing.
Determine how inherent cell factors, genetic manipulation, culture processes relate to desired end application phenotype.
Interface with a diverse array of CAMP teammates and the larger Singapore cell manufacturing community, ranging from engineers to clinicians to GMP manufacturers and regulatory scientists.
Requirements

Background
Driving behaviour models are an integral part of agent-based traffic simulations which define the behaviour of vehicles on the road and thus need to represent reality as closely as possible. Models of human drivers become even more relevant nowadays in the context of mixed traffic simulation (humans interacting with autonomous vehicles). Typically, driving behaviour models (stochastic or deterministic) are constructed using domain knowledge and are thus analytical in nature. With recent advancements of machine learning techniques and specifically black-box, data-driven modelling approaches such as ANNs, the question stands whether human-driver behaviour can also be estimated well-enough by those techniques, thus surpassing the current state of the art.

Objective and tasks
The goal of this project is to evaluate and compare the descriptive potential of 1) an analytical statistical human driver model and 2) a black-box model realized using an artificial neural network. The student would be required to become familiar with the inputs and outputs of human driving behaviour models and the role they play in traffic simulations. Furthermore, the two models need to be calibrated using real life data and their performance needs to be compared. Completing the project would include the following steps:


1. Identification and preparation of the data set that will be used to create and test the models
2. Calibration of analytical statistical human driver model
3. Literature review to identify the most suitable neural network architecture and training of the model
4. Design of metrics and experiments to compare the two models
5. Results post-processing and analysis
6. Report writing

What we expect from you
Object-oriented programming concepts
C++
Statistical Modelling
Scripting
Basic understanding of discrete event simulations

What we offer you
An international and multidisciplinary working environment
Opportunity to work on a project with real-life relevance
Work with researches from world-renowned Universities

1151,30,Singapore,Data scientist,"Research Analyst, Shared Services and Outsourcing Network - Analytics (SSONA)",IQPC,,,,Central Singapore,"In 2016, Havard Business Review proclaimed the “data scientist” as the sexiest role of the 21st century. At SSON Analytics, we believe that data science is just the first step of the analytics journey, and that coupling a great data scientist with a great Research Analyst is the key to creating real and valuable business insights.
We consider our Research Analysts as investigative journalists armed with factual evidence. They piece together the data puzzle, draw out industry insights that tell the real story, then translate the critical headlines to the SSON community. These visual analytics reports present the facts neutrally, both on where the market trends currently sit, and where they are most probably headed (based purely upon data results from indexes and scientific formulae). SSON Analytics does not dabble in subjective guesswork. We deal in hard facts and our Research Analysts are focused on assessing both the now, and what predictably is likely to be next for our customers and their SSO strategies.
We are looking for a bright and inquisitive individual to join the growing SSON Analytics team inside SSON’s Global Analytics centre. This is a fantastic opportunity to be exposed to the exciting world of data analytics. It may suit an accomplished post graduate looking for their first step on the Analytics ladder, and could also act as a perfect stepping stone for more experienced producers and researchers who are looking to bridge their careers into the Data Analytics industry.
Responsibilities:
Researching, Analysing and validating both structured and unstructured data sets (including public external sources and SSON’s proprietary global data sets from multiple channels )
Project managing the design, creation and upgrade of interactive research tools inside SSON Analytics website (e.g. City Cube, Intelligent Automation Universe)
Writing industry copy to translate data headlines to the “story” each analytics report contains
Conducting independent online research
Engaging and interviewing both buy and sell side industry leaders (both f2f and telephone) to source/confirm/identify data sets
Working closely with internal cross functional team (data science, web development, marketing, events teams)

Requirements
The ideal candidate will:
have a bachelors degree (a background in market research, marketing, data research/analytics is of interest but not essential)
be confident in engaging senior SSON industry members by telephone
be an excellent communicator
be able to think for themselves, offering creative solutions and ideas to enhance projects
be interested in learning about business strategy
have an inquisitive mind and demonstrate intellectual curiosity
be eager to learn
be comfortable with a deadline driven environment for producing reports
be resourceful and flexible
be organized, accurate and detail-oriented
have a great attitude and be willing to adapt to change
enjoy data research and the challenge of finding missing data
the ability to speak any additional languages would be an advantage
